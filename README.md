# The Odin Project | Intermediate HMTL and CSS: Admin Dashboard
## [Live Deployed Site](https://snub-yeah.github.io/odin-admin-dashboard/)

This is a project made as part of The Odin Project. It is an admin dashboard focused on layout and stylization with little focus on functionality. It also has a switch between light and dark theme. The project description can be found on the official [Odin Project site](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard). Enjoy.
## Features
The main "features" required for this project were just a static page with a nice layout. Other than that, the page features:
- Dark mode switch
- Multiple animations when interacting with the page
- Secret Fortnite Button
## Technologies
This site is made mostly with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses Google Fonts and Font Awesome for a bit of extra swag.
